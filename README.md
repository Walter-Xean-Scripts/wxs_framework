# wxs_framework
WXS Framework - A framework which aims for good code, compatability and performance.
Right now it's under very heavy development, so it's **not** something you can or should use in production at the moment.
Besides the QB & ESX bridges aren't finished, so there's no scripts for it currently.

## Dependencies
